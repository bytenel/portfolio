                    Built an enterprise data warehousing system with a team of developers and manual QA engineers. Created a platform in ASP.NET MVC 4 used to manage SQL Server jobs and browse and
                    manage the metadata database. Expanded functionality of an existing application to map database systems and flat files to a metadata database. All projects shipped on time and

                    Assisted with Professor Feifei Li's CS5530 – Database Systems course which was an undergraduate-level introduction to database systems and applications using databases. Held office
                    hours where I mentored students in many database and software engineering related topics. Graded papers, made and produced keys in LaTeX, and met with students for additional
                    assistance outside office hours. Topics included SQL, relational, ISAM, and NoSQL databases, data modeling, and more.

                    Focused undergraduate education on strong software engineering and web development skills. Was heavily involved in data mining, natural language processing and database research as
                    an upperclassman. Built many large projects in teams of 4+ members and took several graduate level courses as an undergrad. Projects include a DNA and RNA generator that validated
                    genes to the BLAST database, a project correlating sentiment analysis of Twitter data with stock data, a capstone which was a Rails application engineered to help people learn, and
                    a coreference resolution processor. 3.151 GPA including graduate level courses.
